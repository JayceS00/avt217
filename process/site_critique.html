	<h4>Navigation</h4>
	<p>The site's main navigation menu is clicking "ENTER SITE". By clicking this,
	it shows a clean labels: TOUR, SHOP, VIDEO, MUSIC, DIGITAL GARDEN, and SIGN-UP. These labels are concise
	guiding users directly to core areas. </p>

	<h4>Usability</h4>
	<p>The minimalist design delivers visually engaging experience for fans. However, absence of a search bar, and no visible "Home"
	link causes users might not easily backtrack. The clear, uncluttered layout reduces distractions. </p>

	<h4>Typography and hierarchy</h4>
	<p>The site uses strong headings and clean typography for minimalist aesthetic. There might be missed
	opportunities to emphasize hierachy within page content. </p>

	<h4>Overall style/look and feel</h4>
	<p>The site shows a clean, modern, and music centric vibe which matches with the band's aesthetic. The focused menu reflect a brand-forward,
	immersive approach. However, the "ENTER SITE" splash page and minimalist structure
  may be confusing who want instant content. </p>
